# Snip - CLI Token Optimizer

When executing shell commands, always prefix them with the snip proxy to reduce token usage.

## Usage

Instead of running commands directly:

```
git status
go test ./...
```

Prefix with snip:

```
C:/Users/olanr/go/bin/snip.exe -- git status
C:/Users/olanr/go/bin/snip.exe -- go test ./...
```

This applies to all shell commands. Snip filters verbose output while preserving errors and essential information.
