# User Roles

## Introduction

Salafi Durus is built around clearly defined user roles. These roles are not merely permission sets; they reflect distinct responsibilities, expectations, and trust boundaries within the platform.

Clear role separation is essential to maintaining:

- Content authenticity
- Editorial accountability
- A predictable and secure system

This document outlines the primary roles within Salafi Durus and explains why these distinctions matter.

## Role Philosophy

Salafi Durus follows a principle of **explicit responsibility**.

Each role:

- Has a clearly defined purpose
- Is granted only the permissions necessary to fulfill that purpose
- Operates within well-defined boundaries

This prevents ambiguity, reduces misuse, and ensures that trust is preserved at every level of the system.

The platform currently defines three core roles:

- Listener
- Administrator
- Scholar / Content Editor

---

## Listener

### Purpose

The Listener is the primary beneficiary of Salafi Durus.

Listeners engage with the platform to:

- Access authentic Salafi lectures
- Follow structured series
- Study at their own pace
- Retain and revisit knowledge over time

### Capabilities

Listeners can:

- Browse scholars, series, and lectures
- Stream and download lectures for offline listening
- Resume playback from their last position
- Mark lectures as favorites
- Maintain a personal listening history

These capabilities are focused entirely on consumption and learning.

### Limitations

Listeners cannot:

- Publish or modify content
- Upload media
- Influence public visibility of lectures
- Interact socially through comments or public feedback

This limitation is intentional. It preserves clarity and avoids the risks associated with open user-generated content.

---

## Administrator

### Purpose

Administrators are the custodians of the platform.

They are responsible for:

- Maintaining content quality
- Ensuring methodological consistency
- Managing the overall integrity of Salafi Durus

Administrators hold the highest level of trust and authority within the system.

### Capabilities

Administrators can:

- Create, edit, and manage scholars
- Create, edit, and manage series
- Upload, replace, and organize lectures
- Publish, archive, or unpublish content
- Perform bulk operations on lectures and series
- Moderate content quickly and decisively
- Access administrative tools from both web and mobile interfaces

Administrative tools are designed for speed, clarity, and reliability rather than complexity.

### Responsibility and Accountability

With elevated permissions comes responsibility.

Administrative actions:

- Are authoritative
- Affect public-facing content
- Must be reversible when errors occur

The system is designed to support correction and responsiveness, not to encourage unchecked changes.

---

## Scholar / Content Editor

### Purpose

Scholar / Content Editors represent a scoped administrative role.

They are entrusted to manage content related to specific scholars or subject areas without having unrestricted control over the entire platform.

This role exists to:

- Enable direct involvement from scholars or their representatives
- Distribute content management responsibility
- Preserve central oversight while allowing autonomy

### Capabilities

Scholar Editors can:

- Manage their assigned scholar profiles
- Create and edit series under their scope
- Upload and manage lectures within their scope
- Edit metadata and correct mistakes
- Replace audio files when necessary

Depending on policy, they may:

- Publish content directly
- Or submit content for administrative review before publication

### Limitations

Scholar Editors cannot:

- Manage scholars outside their assigned scope
- Deactivate other scholars
- Access platform-wide administrative controls
- Override core moderation rules

These limitations ensure that distributed management does not compromise consistency or trust.

---

## Role Separation and Trust

The separation between Listener, Administrator, and Scholar Editor is foundational.

It ensures that:

- Consumption remains simple and distraction-free
- Editorial control remains accountable
- Authority is granted intentionally, not implicitly

Blurring these roles would increase risk, reduce clarity, and undermine confidence in the platform.

---

## Evolution of Roles

The current role model is intentionally minimal.

Future roles may be introduced as the platform evolves, but only if they:

- Serve a clear purpose
- Preserve existing trust boundaries
- Do not dilute accountability

Any expansion of roles should be approached with caution and aligned with the core philosophy of Salafi Durus.

---

## Closing Note

Roles in Salafi Durus are not about power; they are about responsibility.

By clearly defining who can do what—and why—the platform maintains a stable foundation for growth, moderation, and long-term preservation of knowledge.
